## New Release
I am more than happy to say that this website is near release. As of the time when this post was created, you were probably bored of the old look of my website. Well yes, it's been in the state of reworks for a while now. The reason for that is because I couldn't be bothered to create a website for ***myself***, it's lazy, but yeah. I finally regained motivation to create a website, and just motivation for web development in general. Web development is a thing I enjoy to do, it cheers me up.

## Your opinions
Please feel free to give me feedback over here on Discord: **Marino#0001**, this website was fun to make, really. So, I'd be glad to hear some positive feedback, including feature requests. They're always welcome. Always. Please tell me if there are any bugs within this website so I can fix them as fast as possible.

## Blog section
The Blog section of the website was the most fun part, and frustrating part of the website. But, the thing that saved me from all the markdown API hustle is a module made by the Nuxt.js team that goes by the name of `@nuxtjs/content`. It helps you with parsing markdown files and other types.

## Contributions
All contributions to the website code-related or not are always welcome. I understand if you're not willing to contribute on a personal website, and that's completely fine. Contributing is optional, and will always be. Visit the [GitHub](https://github.com/marinofranz/MarinoCodes) to contribute to this website code-related. If you intend to contribute, please understand that this website utilizes Vue.js and Nuxt.js, so, it is recommended to have some knowledge of that before contributing.

## Upcoming Features
There will be a lot of new features in the future. By a lot, I mean a lot. If I have the motivation, of course, haha. Anyway, back to the point. If you'd like to see a feature, please, do send them to my Discord: **Marino#0001**

Hopefully you'll all love those upcoming features, we'll see! :)
